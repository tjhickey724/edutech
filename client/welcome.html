					The Brandeis Educational Technology Group seeks to understand how we can use technology-enhanced
					pedagogy to revolutionize our approach to education and greatly expand the effectiveness and efficiency
					of our educational institutions world-wide.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are especially interested in the use of technology to flip large classes, both face-to-face
					and virtual. The goal is not to replace human-human interaction with human-computer interaction,
					but rather to use technology to increase the level and quality of interaction among students in a class.
